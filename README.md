Assignemnts and related material from [Online Training: Mobile Robotics](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgnQpQtFTOGSeTU35ojkOdsscnenP2Cqx) taught by Dr. Cyrill Stachniss.

1. **Recursive Bayesian filter** : It is a probabilistic approac to estimate a PDF (Probability Density Function) given a prior, process and measurement model.  
[Here](Recursive%20Bayes%20Filter/ex2_1.ipynb) we have implemented the algorithm on a non-cyclic world. The probability histogram is attached below.

2. **Occupancy grid mapping** : Mapping is on of the essential components of an Autonomous robot.In occupancy grid mapping, the world is discretized into grids where in each cell is assigned a probability of it being occupied or not.  
[Here](Occupancy%20Grid%20mapping/ex3.ipynb) we have used a data file consisting of raw ranges and robot pose values was used. The raw values were converted into cell values of the grid cell by using bresenhams line algorithm and the map resolution was set as 0.25

3. **Motion model** The motion model of a robot gives the probability of the state given the previous state and control inputs. [The given assignment](Motion%20model/ex4.ipynb) utilises odometry motion model which summarises the motion as a combination of a rotation, translation and rotation vector. Since the odometry model uses a lot of computation we performed sampling based odometry to estimate the motion of a robot (output attached below)

4. **Observation model** gives the porbability of the observation given the robot state and the map (or position of landmark). In [this assignment](Observation%20model/ex5.ipynb) an observation modelof a range finder sensor was developed. The model is composed of a gaussian noise distribution, a random noise, a max range noise and a dynamic obstacle noise.

5. **Kalman filter** is an estimation algorithm used for linear models and assumes gaussian noise. It has a prediction and a correction (or update) step which finally outputs the estimate of the state by calculating the Kalman gain. In the given assignment the KF was used to estimate the height of a falling object with given observations. The algorithm was tested on a perfect sensor and a very noisy sensor and observations are attached.

6. **Extended Kalman filter based localization** Localization is the task of estimating the robots pose given the observations and Map information. Since most real world robot models use non linear models for motions, the common Kalman filter cannot be used. Instead we use the Extended Kalman Filter. In EKF we use first order taylor expansion to linearise the function (local linearization) and then perform the prediction and update steps similar to the Kalman Filter.  
   In the given [excercise](EKF%20Localization/ex6.ipynb) the odometry and range measurements from a differential drive robot was given and the task was to localize the robot in a feature based map with known correspondence.

7. **Monte Carlo Localization** algorithm attempts to solve the localization problem using the particle filter approach.  The particle filter approach uses a set of particles to represent the given state space. And then we perform a set of weighing and resampling steps over the entire set of particles. By assigning higher weights and resampling based on these weights we get a high concentration of particles at the configuration that has the highest probability.  
   In the given [excercise](Monte%20Carlo%20Localization/ex7.ipynb) the odometry data from a differential drive robot was given and the task was to localize the robot in the given map.

8. **Path planning** The path planning problem basically estimates a path from a given node to a goal node in a given mapped terrain. The path planning algorithms are of two types:  
      1. Informed :  
   In informed search the algorithm has some information about the cost to the goal node, usually in the form of heruristics.  
   eg. A*, Greedy search etc.
      1. Uninformed :  
   In uninformed the algorithm doesnt have a heuristic usually estimates costs from origin node to current node.  
   eg. Djikstra, BFS,DFS etc.  
   
   In the following assignment path planning was performed on an occupancy grid map using greedy search and A*. It was found that the computational speed can be significantly improved by applying a gaussian blur over the map provided.

   ```
   A star algorithm

   open = []
   closed =[]
   neighbors = []

   while open:
      open.sort()
      current = open[0]
      if current == goal:
         return path
         break
      else:
         closed.append(current)
         for all valid neighbors of current:
            if neighbor not in closed list:
               new cost = cost to node + cost from node to goal
               if neighbor in open:
                  if cost > new cost:
                     cost = new cost
                     parent = current
               else:
                  open.append(neighbor)
                  cost = new cost
                  parent = current

   ```

9. **Iterative Closest Point** : The point cloud data from Lidar or depth scans is not aligned. So for SLAM and other applications we need to match the cordinate frames of corresponding clouds. This can be done for both cases, known correspondeces and unknown correspondence between points.  
   The algorithm for ICP is fairly straight forward.
   ```
   1. Define an initial guess
   2. Initialize initial error to infinity
   3. While Error is decreasing or Max iterations not reached 
      3.1  Calcualte correspondences
      3.2  Compute the Rotation and Translation vectors.
      3.3 Calculate Error and New guess
   ```

   In the given assignment, KDtree algorithm was used to find correspondence between points.

10. **Graph SLAM** : SLAM or simulataneous localization and mapping is one of the important and most researched areas in robotics. The SLAM problem is inherently complex because we are trying to map the surrounding while simulateously localizing itself withing the said map.  
Traditonal approaches like EKF based SLAM treated it as an estimation problem while modern approach as graph based SLAM treat it as an optimization problem.  
In graph SLAM based approach the poses of the robot are modeled as the nodes and the edges are constraints between these nodes, either odometry constraints or observation constraints. Thus the SLAM problem essentially seeks to optimize these constraints so as to get the optimal graph. This solves the full SLAM problem.
