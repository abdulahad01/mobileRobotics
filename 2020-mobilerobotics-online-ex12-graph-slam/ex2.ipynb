The data is provided as a graph structure containing nodes (poses and landmarks) and constraints between these nodes (i.e pose-pose and pose-landmark). These datasets are stored as `dataset.g2o` text files. You are provided with the following datasets (see `data` folder), each of which represents the measurements of one SLAM problem.\n",

If the node has a dimension of 2, it represents the location of landmark (`VERTEX_XY`).\n",

    "`toNode`: `nodeId` of the node to which the edge terminates to.\n",
    "`measurement`: The measurement corresponding to the edge.\n",
    "`information`: The corresponding information matrix for the edge constraint.\n",
